				<h1>A little about me.</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm Sarah, a punctuation pirate, word wrangler, and professional legal proofreader.
				</p> 
				<p>The best part of my job is helping people polish their hard work to ensure the integrity of the finished product. As a trained legal proofreader, I’m able to catch errors specific to legal transcripts so that you submit the most accurate representations to your clients. 
				</p>
				<p><strong>Let me help your work reach the top.</strong></p>

					<h3>What I do</h3>
					<p>I search for typographical and grammatical errors, punctuation accuracy and consistency, mistaken homophones, and incorrect spelling. I also make sure that formatting, dates, names, exhibits, and page numbers are accurate and consistent throughout the transcript.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="third-width">
					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<p>I received training specific to legal transcript proofreading through a course based on Morson’s English Guide called Transcript Proofreading: Practice and Theory. I have since proofed myriad transcripts, including Examinations Under Oath, depositions, hearings, medical transcripts, workers’ compensation claims, malpractice claims, expert testimony, and general litigation.</p>

				<div class="third-width">
					<h3>Method</h3>
					<p>I mark corrections directly onto the .pdf file using iAnnotate, and send you back the corrected pages unless the entire transcript is requested. Click here to read more about my method.</p>
